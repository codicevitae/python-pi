* Building blocks - binary representation
    * If one wishes to build a large building (skyscraper perhaps) they would not bring in many people to dig the large ditch for the foundation. Instead, they would use powerful machines and tools to do the job. 
    * The same is in software development. Tools and languages have been developed and built up to remove the tedious jobs and allow for more to be accomplish in less time, with fewer people. 
    * Nobody programs in binary or machine language (unless a very specific task that is not the norm). Instead, a high level language is used, that then gets translated into machine language that the processor understands. 
    * Compilers are used to translate from a high level language into a machine language. 
    * Programming languages provide a strict rules for expressing what task the machine should perform.
        * example: 
        ``` 
        cost_of_pizza = 30
        number_of_people = 6
        cost_per_person = cost_of_pizza / number_of_people
        ```
