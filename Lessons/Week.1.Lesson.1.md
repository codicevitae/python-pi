Lesson: Computers and programs

####Goals 
* To understand the roles of hardware and software in computer systems.
* To understand the basic design of a modern computer.
* To understand how to run a python script. 
* To learn the purpose of a programming language.

####Definitions
* Computer: **A machine that can carry out a sequence of operations as specified in a computer program.**
* Computer program: **A detailed set of instructions telling a computer exactly what to do.**

####Objectives 
* Ability to explain the differences between hardware/software.
* Ability to execute a python program. 


####Anticipatory Set (hardware)
* Have you ever used a computer before (raise of hands)? 
* What is a computer? What is required for something to be considered a computer? 
    - microwave
    - doorbell
    - vending machine
    - lamp
* Who knows what this is?

* It isn't required to know all the details about a computer to be a computer scientist, but it helps (as knowing a few things about a car helps any driver).
* The main parts of a computer are:
    * CPU
    * Volatile or main memory (RAM)
    * Permanent memory (hard disk drive (HDD), solid state drive (SSD))
    * Input devices (mouse, keyboard)
    * Output devices (monitor, printer)
* Every computer is just a machine for executing programs.
* Computers have become as common place as automobiles. However, understanding how they work are a different matter.
* Computers are to computer science as telescopes are to astronomy. They (computers) are an important tool in the subject, but not the sole focus of it.

####Anticipatory set (software /programs)
* Computer software (programs): "And the borrower is servant to the lender" or rather, the hardware is servant to the software. 
* The way to get the hardware to perform actions is via software, and specifically software programming. 
* Software is written in one or more programming languages. 
* A programming language is either compiled or interpreted. 
    * A **compiled** language takes the human readable text, and compiles it to a form that the CPU can directly execute. 
    * An **interpreted** language will execute the code instruction at a time, via an interpreter (aka virtual machine).
* What happens when the language is abiguous?

* The language we will be using is call python. It is an interpreted language.

####Command line
* One **tool** that will be used to run, execute, and utilize the computer will be the command line.
* Some commands to get around:
    * ls - prints all files/folders in the current directory
    * cd - changes the current directory to a new one
    * mkdir - creates a new directory with the given name
    * mv - moves a file/folder from one location to another
    * cat - prints the contents of a file
    * cp - copies a file/folder from one location to another
    * nano - starts the text editor we will use in class to create our programs
    * When in doubt, 'tool name' --help to see options
* Since this is linux, file paths are deliminated with the / character, instead of the \ character.

####Activity
* Explain the steps for a robot to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwhich. Pass out a sheet of paper, work in teams of 2-3 students (15 mins). 
* Unpack the raspberry pi, point out the various parts, boot to the console, explore some commands (30 mins).

####Stretch activity
* Further work for the students who finish the first lab early. Generally includes exercies that solidify the topic further by giving more complex problems to solve. 

####Wrap up
* A short summary of the topics at the end of class to help review what was learned. 

####Assessment / Reflection 
* Wrap up summary in binder
