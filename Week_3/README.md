# Abstraction

We went through this [deck](https://1drv.ms/p/s!AlitrBXgrF2BiukPWg25RIhGYUNm0g?e=CqBvZd), here, beginning with a discussion of abstract art and ending with a better understanding of bits, bytes.

We finished class by looking at some simple demos of the cardiod/fractal generation, located [here](./cardiod/index.html).
