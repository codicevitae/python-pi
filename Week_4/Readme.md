Lesson: Conditional Execution

#### Goals:
* To understand the value of conditional execution
* To understand how to test for conditions
* To understand if and if-else statements
* To understand Python's if-else syntax and indentation requirements

#### Limitations of Linear Program Flow
* PB&J Example for issuing instructions
* All instructions executed once and once only
* No chance to deal with problems that arise

#### Logical Conditions
* Have already covered Boolean type (TRUE/FALSE)
* >, <, ==, !, etc
* ||, &&, ()

#### Testing for Conditions
* Simple boolean statements (x < y)
* Compound boolean statements (x < y || x == 1)
* Assigning result of statement to variable (b = x < y)

#### If statements
* Simple IF 
* IF-ELSE
* IF-ELIF-ELSE
* Nested IF statements (cyclical complexity?)
* Short-circuiting

#### Python particulars
* colon
* indentation
* multiple statement blocks

#### Lab Exercises
* TBD
