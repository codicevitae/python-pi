Lesson: Conditional Execution

#### Goals:
* To understand what an algorithm is
* To understand the value of conditional execution
* To understand how to test for conditions
* To understand if and if-else statements
* To understand Python's if-else syntax and indentation requirements

#### Algorithms
* How do you define a process or solution to a problem?
* How do you make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?
* An algorithm is a set of instructions designed to achieve a certain goal or solve a certain problem
* We all use algorithms every day of our lives, we just may not call them that
  1. How do you get ready for school in the morning?
  2. How do you make your bed?
  3. How do you make a Peanut Butter Sandwich?

#### Limitations of Linear Program Flow
* So far the instructions you have given the computer have been linear sequences of simple instructions
* All instructions executed once and once only
* No chance to deal with problems that arise
* Using PB&J algorithm from above, discuss the drawbacks of having one fixed set of instrctions that happen once each
  * What if the bag of bread is empty?
  * How do you know when to stop putting PB on the bread?
  * What if you stop after one scoop of jelly? Is it enough?
  * What if you run out of Peanut Butter?
  * What if you have more than one kind of jelly?

#### Logical Conditions
* Have already covered Boolean type (TRUE/FALSE)
* `<, >, ==, !, etc`
* `||, &&, ()`

#### Testing for Conditions
* Simple boolean statements (x < y)
* Compound boolean statements (x < y || x == 1)
* Assigning result of statement to variable (b = x < y)

#### If statements
* Simple IF 
* IF-ELSE
* IF-ELIF-ELSE
* Nested IF statements (cyclical complexity?)
* Short-circuiting

#### Python particulars
* colon
* indentation
* multiple statement blocks

#### Lab Exercises
* TBD
